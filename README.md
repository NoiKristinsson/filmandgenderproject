# filmandgenderproject
Project I am working on related to gender and filmmakers

There are a few scrapers I did instead of making a one.

The firstone was to scrape the Top lists from IMDB based on years. => name of movie | Year | Url
and export to a CSV

the next one imported that CSV and searched for specific crew on TMDB and scraped that to a CSV file.

The third one (Still not published) takes the first name of actors and crew and finds the gender.
